# Alpha-GameEngine

This is a personal project that I embarked upon with the intent of learning game engine development.

It is written in Visual C++, using OpenGL 4 as the graphics API and Bullet Physics for the physics engine. The architecture is based on the book "Game Coding Complete - Fourth Edition by Mike McShaffry and David Graham".
